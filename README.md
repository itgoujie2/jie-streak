**Task Description**
The task is to make a visualization of all emails from employees of company X to all other companies they have talked to. I'll leave this intentionally vague but PLEASE ask me follow up questions. 

You can assume your input is a CSV file where each line follows the following format:

from_email, [array of recipient email addresses ], timestamp, subject, message_id

What I'd like you to do is to generate and parse a sample dataset. Then come up with a great visualization which answers the following questions using a visualization:

1) Which companies do the employees of company X talk to the most?
2) For each of those companies, which employees of company X talk to which employees of the other company?

**Instructions**
1) Go to jie-streak.herokuapp.com, upload your csv file
